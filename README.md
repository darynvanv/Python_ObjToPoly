# Python Obj to Poly  
This is a simple project that accepts an OBJ and outputs a .plf (Poly-Line File), which is a set of points to draw a polygon, per line of the file. 
This makes it easy to parse and output the polygons with any 2D drawing system, such as for SVGs or image editing like Imagick and PIL.


## Usage
`python obj2plf.py -i <path/to/file/or/folder> -o <path/to/file/or/folder>`
